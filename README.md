# Mineflayer kit bot originally made for 0b0t

## Preparation
1. Set the account's spawn
2. Place chests and hoppers to supply them around it, in a way that all chests are within 5 blocks of the spawn, and the hopper that supplies the rest is closest to the spawn

## Usage
1. Copy "default.json" into another file called "config.json", and configure it
2. Run `npm install` (Only required the first time)
3. Run `npm start`

This was my first node.js project so i may be missing some javascript specific things, feel free to make an issue or PR pointing them out
